3 by 3 multiplication thingy

# what this does!
this **Rust** script starts by having a mental breakdown because "x" changed values, then it asks for x, y and z, you type whatever numbers you want here (**DECIMAL NUMBERS AREN'T SUPPORTED!** .w.) then you enter another set of x, y and z values, and the script multiplies them like this:

ax * bx
ax * by
ax * bz

and so on!

sorry if my explanation sucks! .w.
